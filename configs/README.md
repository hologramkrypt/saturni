### Notes on Configuration
> **NOTE:**
> If you are willing to tinker, I've tried to make my setup as streamlined as possible. You may need to check and maybe change your *$HOME* paths so that youre pointing at the correct folders. Everything here is modular, and it is a work in progress getting the build to a point where certain modules can be removed/replaced at will.

###### Config folders are located in...

```bash
