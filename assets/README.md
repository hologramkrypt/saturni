# *Assets* 

This is where youll find all my *wallpapers, icons, cursors,* and *themes*

_Note: Please refer to [Gnome Look](https://www.gnome-look.org/browse?ord=rating) for more themes to fit your style. The ones i use are linked in the repo, within their respective README's_

_Note: Cursor files should be placed within ~/.icons_

### Folder structure should look like this...




## *nwg-look*

**nwg-look** is a tool used to apply your themes, icons and
cursors within GTK+ programs (like Thunar). This will generate the config files for you
so that you dont need to do it manually. More info can be found at [nwg-look](https://nwg-piotr.github.io/nwg-shell/nwg-look.html).

I would also recommend looking into [Kvantum](https://github.com/tsujan/Kvantum/blob/master/Kvantum/INSTALL.md) if you use Qt programs/widgets.

_Note: An exception to the no substitution rule, you can use lxappearance to replace nwg-look if necessary, or if certain GTK2 apps arent holding their theme, however I do not recommend this, ad lxappearance has
shown to be unreliable on multiple occasions._
