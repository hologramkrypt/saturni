# *Assets* 

This is where youll find all my *wallpapers, icons, cursors,* and *themes*

_Note: Please refer to [Gnome Look](https://www.gnome-look.org/browse?ord=rating) for more themes to fit your style. The ones i use are linked in the repo, within their respective README's_

_Note: Cursor files should be placed within ~/.icons_

### Folder structure should look like this...


## *gsettings*

**gsettings** is a command line tool used to manage your theming settings across GTK apps. This can be used in succession to the programs listed below if you're comfortable with the terminal. Its basically a terminal based frontend for managing your GTK Settings.

_Note: I would **HIGHLY** recommend downloading this, as it is referenced in many scripts and config files throughout the repo.

## *nwg-look*

**nwg-look** is a tool used to apply your themes, icons and
cursors within GTK+ programs (like Thunar). This will generate the config files for you
so that you dont need to do it manually. More info can be found at [nwg-look](https://nwg-piotr.github.io/nwg-shell/nwg-look.html).

_Note: An exception to the no substitution rule, you can use lxappearance to replace nwg-look if necessary, or if certain GTK2 apps arent holding their theme, however I do not recommend this, ad lxappearance has
shown to be unreliable on multiple occasions._

## *Kvantum* 

I would recommend looking into [Kvantum](https://github.com/tsujan/Kvantum/blob/master/Kvantum/INSTALL.md) if you use Qt programs/widgets. It works in a similar fashion to nwg-look.
